## About AstroMeters

AstroMeters is a team of dedicated hardware and software developers united by a deep passion for astronomy. We founded this company because we weren't entirely satisfied with the current solutions available in the astronomical equipment market. Our mission is to create innovative, high-quality instruments that meet the demanding needs of both amateur and professional astronomers.

### Our Philosophy

Every product under the AstroMeters brand has undergone rigorous testing and evaluation by our own team. We don't just manufacture equipmentâ€”we use it ourselves in real astronomical observations, ensuring that every component meets our high standards for performance and reliability.

### Open Source Commitment

We believe in the power of open-source development. All our products come with open-source hardware designs, firmware, and software, giving you complete freedom to modify, enhance, and customize your equipment to meet your specific needs.

### Our Products

- **AMFOC01**: Advanced precision focuser for astronomical telescopes with USB-C connectivity
- **AMSKY01**: All-in-one sky quality, cloud detection, and environmental monitoring sensor
- **USBMOUNT01**: USB converter for direct telescope mount control from your computer

### Community & Support
