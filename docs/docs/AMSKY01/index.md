# AMSKY01 – All-in-one Sky Quality and Cloud Sensor

The AMSKY01 is a compact, weatherproof sky sensor designed for astronomical and environmental applications. It combines multiple sensors in one unit:

- **Sky brightness sensor (SQM)** – measures sky brightness in mag/arcsec².
- **Infrared cloud sensor** – detects cloud presence by measuring sky temperature.
- **Temperature and humidity sensor** – monitors ambient air conditions.
- **USB-C and RS-485 interfaces** – for easy connection to PCs or automation systems.

## Key Features

- Real-time **sky quality measurements** (SQM) to assess light pollution.
- Fast and reliable **cloud detection** using infrared sky temperature.
- Accurate **ambient temperature and humidity** monitoring.
- **USB-C (CDC Serial)** interface for plug-and-play operation with computers.
- **RS-485** interface for integration with observatory or building automation.
- **Open protocol** and API documentation for custom applications.
- Designed for **continuous outdoor use** in observatory conditions.

## Applications

- Light pollution monitoring.
- Automatic observatory control (e.g., dome closure during clouds).
- Weather condition logging for astronomical sites.
- Networked sky sensor systems and citizen science projects.
- Environmental data collection and automation.
