# AMASC01 Thermal Control System

The AMASC01 AllSky camera includes an integrated thermal management system designed to maintain optimal operating conditions and prevent condensation, ensuring reliable all-weather imaging throughout the year.

## Overview

The thermal control system consists of:

- **Dome Heating** – prevents condensation and ice formation on the optical dome
- **Active Ventilation** – maintains stable internal temperature and prevents overheating
- **CPU Cooling** – dedicated cooling for CPU
- **Environmental Sensors** – comprehensive monitoring system including:
  - **Dome sensor** – optical dome temperature measurement
  - **Body sensor** – camera body temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure
  - **External sensor** – ambient environmental conditions
- **Automatic Control** – intelligent climate management based on environmental conditions
- **Allsky Software Integration** – seamless integration with AllskyTeam/allsky software

The system utilizes custom-designed hardware components specifically engineered for long durability in demanding outdoor environments.
