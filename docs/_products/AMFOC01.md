**AMFOC01 – Advanced Open-Source Telescope Focuser**

Take your astronomical imaging and observing to the next level with the AMFOC01—an advanced focuser designed for demanding astronomers and tinkerers. Engineered for precise, smooth, and ultra-quiet focusing, AMFOC01 uses the state-of-the-art TMC5130 micro-stepping driver and RP2040 processor to eliminate vibration and guarantee repeatable results, night after night.

Although AMFOC01 is built primarily for astronomical telescopes, its flexible, adaptable design means it can serve in a wide range of optical applications, including scientific and DIY setups. Full open-source hardware, firmware, and software ensure total freedom for modifications and custom integrations.


### Key Features

* **Smooth, High-Precision Focusing:**
  The combination of TMC5130 micro-stepping and the modern RP2040 processor guarantees gentle, accurate, and silent focus adjustments—no more image shifts or motor jitters.
* **Universal Power Compatibility:**
  Operates on 9–16 V DC, so you can power it from a car battery, field supply, or observatory setup. Uses a standard 5.5/2.1 mm coaxial connector.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**
  Large red OLED display with four intuitive buttons makes manual focusing a breeze—even in complete darkness. Connect to your computer via USB-C and control AMFOC01 with any MoonLite-compatible software (such as KStars/INDI/Ekos).
* **Real-Time Temperature Compensation:**
  Built-in thermometer enables automatic focus correction as ambient temperature changes—perfect for astrophotography and long observing sessions.
* **Manual or Automated Control:**
  Enjoy the freedom to focus using either the convenient hand controller or advanced automation from your favorite astronomy software.
