Maximize the potential of your telescope mount with direct computer control.

While many amateur astronomers appreciate mounts like Skywatcher for their optimal balance of price and quality, the true potential of many mounts, across various brands, is unlocked when connected to a computer. Enhance your observational capabilities and precision with the USBMOUNT converter.


## Usage Guide

### Setting Up the Connection
- **Computer Connection:** Simply plug the USBMOUNT into your computer using a USB-C cable, like the one you might use for your smartphone. Upon a successful connection, the `PC (pwr)` LED will light up. For optimal performance, it's best to use a high-quality cable.
- **Mount Connection:** The converter features an RJ45 connector. Use either the hand control cable or a direct Ethernet cable for the connection (ensure your mount supports an RJ45 connection - refer to the table below). Once connected, the `MOUNT (pwr)` LED will illuminate.

### Attaching the Device
Attach using the provided 3M DualLock Reclosable Fastener. Before adhering, clean and degrease the surface. Once glued, press down firmly for some time.

For long-distance USBMOUNT (EQmod) operations, opt for a longer RJ45 cable on the telescope side. A standard, shielded ethernet cable is recommended. However, avoid USB cables longer than 5m to maintain reliability.

### LED Alerts
The USBMOUNT features 4 LED indicators. The two red LEDs signal power in the adjacent connector, confirming a successful connection. The two orange LEDs monitor data transfer: `TX` indicates data flowing from the computer to the mount, while `RX` signals the opposite.

### Driver Installation
#### Linux
USBMOUNT01 seamlessly integrates with modern Linux computers. Just connect the device, and you're set to operate USBMOUNT01 with your go-to control software, such as Indi combined with Kstars.

#### Windows

#### Stellarium

#### Kstars/Indi/Ekos
