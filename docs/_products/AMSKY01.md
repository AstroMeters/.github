AMSKY is a versatile, all-in-one sensor for astronomers and observatories.
It measures **sky brightness**, detects **cloud coverage** using advanced sky temperature measurement, and provides ambient **temperature and humidity** readings.

With both USB (CDC serial) and RS485 interfaces, AMSKY01 can be easily connected to computers, automation controllers, or building management systems.
Designed for permanent installations, AMSKY01 delivers all essential environmental data for night sky observation, light pollution monitoring, and observatory automation — in a single, robust device.


## Key Features
**Sky Brightness Measurement**
Real-time readings in magnitudes per square arcsecond (mag/arcsec²) for objective light pollution assessment.

**Cloud Coverage Detection**
Dedicated sky temperature sensor (thermal IR) for fast cloud presence and sky clarity evaluation.

**Ambient Temperature & Humidity**
High-accuracy, calibrated sensors monitor local environmental conditions.

**Dual Interface: USB & RS485**
Plug-and-play via USB-C (CDC serial) for computers, or RS485 for direct integration with observatory or building automation systems (BMS/SCADA).

**Open Protocol & API**
Fully documented for custom integration and automation.

**Weatherproof & Durable**
Rugged enclosure for outdoor and permanent installations.


## Typical Applications
 * Monitoring and documenting light pollution and sky quality.
 * Automated cloud detection for remote or robotic observatories.
 * Integration into building management and dome automation systems via RS485.
 * Environmental monitoring for astronomy and meteorological networks.
 * Citizen science and research projects.
