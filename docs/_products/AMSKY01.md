AMSKY01 is a professional sky quality sensor designed specifically for autonomous and remotely operated observatories.

Unlike traditional single-point cloud detectors, AMSKY01 features a **16×12 pixel MLX9064x thermopile array** that provides detailed sky temperature mapping for precise cloud detection and sky clarity assessment. Combined with an optical sky brightness sensor (outputting both lux and mag/arcsec²) and SHT41 environmental sensor, it delivers comprehensive weather monitoring in a single compact unit. A high-resolution 32×24 pixel variant is also available for enhanced spatial analysis.

With dual connectivity options (USB-C CDC serial and RS485) and an ASCII text-based protocol, AMSKY01 integrates seamlessly into observatory automation systems, SCADA networks, and custom monitoring solutions.


## Key Features

**Pixel Matrix Thermopile Array (MLX9064x)**
Advanced 16×12 pixel IR sensor (32×24 variant available) provides detailed sky temperature mapping for superior cloud detection compared to single-point sensors. Enables spatial analysis of cloud coverage and sky conditions.

**Optical Sky Brightness Measurement**
Dual-output photometric sensor delivers real-time readings in both lux and mag/arcsec² units for standardized sky quality assessment and light pollution monitoring.

**SHT41 Environmental Sensor**
Precision-calibrated temperature and humidity measurement for comprehensive meteorological data collection.

**Flexible Power & Connectivity**
USB-C (5V bus-powered) or external 8-13V DC supply. Dual interface: USB CDC serial for plug-and-play operation, or RS485 for industrial-grade long-distance communication.

**ASCII Text Protocol**
Simple, human-readable command structure enables rapid integration into existing automation systems without complex parsing libraries.

**Outdoor-Rated Design**
Weatherproof enclosure engineered for continuous 24/7 operation in permanent observatory installations.


## Cloud Detection in Action

The following video shows real-time data from the AMSKY01 sensor as cloud coverage develops overhead. The 16×12 pixel thermopile array captures detailed sky temperature distribution across its 110° field of view, enabling precise detection of cloud movement and coverage patterns. Watch how the sensor responds to changing atmospheric conditions in real-time.
