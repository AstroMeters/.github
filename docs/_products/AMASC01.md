# AMASC01 – AstroMeters AllSky Camera

The **AMASC01** is an AllSky camera designed for continuous sky monitoring in astronomical and environmental applications. It integrates the [Sony IMX477](https://www.sony-semicon.com/files/62/pdf/p-13_IMX477-AACK_Flyer.pdf) image sensor with a fisheye f/2 lens, providing high sensitivity required for night-sky imaging and long-term observation.

## Durable Construction for Outdoor Deployment
The camera is housed in a weather-resistant enclosure suitable for year-round outdoor operation. Key design elements include:

- **Wide-angle lens** covering the entire sky.
- **Accessible precision focusing mechanism** enabling straightforward installation and adjustment.
- **Heated optical dome** and **active ventilation**, preventing fogging and helping maintain stable internal conditions to ensure long operational life.

## Integrated Electronics and Sensors
AMASC01 incorporates several internal systems that support autonomous and reliable operation:

- **Environmental sensors** humidity, temperature and pressure.
- **RTC (Real-Time Clock)** for accurate timestamping and work without internet connection.
- **POE power source** for simple installation.
- **Custom control electronics** managing heating, ventilation, and other peripheral components.

## Connectivity and Power
The device supports 1000BASE-T Ethernet communication with **Power over Ethernet (PoE)**, enabling both data transfer and power delivery through a single cable. This simplifies installation, particularly in remote or difficult-to-access locations.

## Software
The AMASC01 camera is shipped **fully pre-installed and pre-configured**. All required software components, system settings, and operational parameters are prepared at the factory, allowing the camera to function immediately after installation.  
No complex modifications or manual configuration steps are needed. Simply connect the device via Ethernet/PoE, access the web interface, and begin operating the system.

The included software stack is based on the open-source project:  
<https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky>

Key features include:
- Configuration of exposure and imaging parameters  
- Image masking capabilities  
- Numerical operations for data processing  
- Modular and customizable architecture  
- Web-based user interface

This setup ensures straightforward operation, high stability, and smooth integration into existing AllSky workflows.
